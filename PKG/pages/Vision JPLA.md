- Kind of scopes;
	- 1. Java engineers
	  2. All developers (tooling)
	  3. ALL people within Picnic (Keycloak)
- ]
- Standardizing
- Unified
- Migration is easy.
- Best practices, maybe that they sometimes even need to think about it.
-
-
- Disavantages / wrong"".
	- We are not involved in other teams.
	- Stopped looking for what can be solved in more generic way.
	- Less activity. Less things happening in PSM.
	- Not improve quality of PSM, does not improve experience.
-
- Working together with other teams to improve the existing tools.
- Created so many tools.
- More ideas on how to improve things will make things worse.
-
- Currently three big maintenance project.
- Keycloak; rabbitMQ; Spinnaker.
-
- The Design phase.
-
- Split services in Platform part and JAVA platform part.
	- So DSL part is more like the JPLA part.
	- Get a split?
	- Stuff like agents and all is for other people
	- What actual steps should be executed during the build would be only small part for TeamCity stuff ingeneral. We should say, what is best way to build Java code. TC or CI team should focuson what CAN be done, what is running.
- ^ works for other services as well.
-
- We feel there is a split. We want to decide/advice/help out how people use it.
-
- Missing things;
	- Picnic-shared-tools (maybe make Java specific)
	- Global-gateway
	- Danger
	- Tools-downloader.
-
- Renovate to write.
- Web-app to Deploy;K8s.
