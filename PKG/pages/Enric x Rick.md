- ING 19 december - internal event
  
  During the first half a year, I mentored Gijs de Jong, who was a working student at that time.
  
  Result of investing time in Error Prone Support:
- Getting an invite to the TNO ESI group for Software Maintenance and Rejuvenation.
- Being able to write two articles in the NLJUG Java Magazin
- Getting invited to conferences.
- Open-source contributions.
- 20+ people that were going through the interview process at Picnic and knowing the project. Some even mentioned it as partial reason of looking into Picnic specifically.
- Getting two people to do a Lunch & Learn @ Picnic.
- Collaboration with Moderne.
  
  Stewardship of multiple different tools within Picnic (and within our team):
- Error Prone (Support)
- OpenRewrite
- ArchUnit
- Spinnaker
- ```
  ```
-
- ## L3 stuff
- Domains authority;
- Really doing design of a feature completely;
-
-
- # General feedback Enric L3
-
- ## General high level feedbac on L3
- Take over more of cross team responsibilities.
- For example, handle the check in with migration of Article issue service.
	- Ideal case, Enric wouldn't need to be here. I can take it over, look into it, discuss it with Steffen or Enric and handle it for them.
-
- **Extra mile**, what would this look like; multiplier so think about how is this used.
	- When developing; trying to see what are the links to other products
	- During discussions; some other people bring up topics.
	- Flag which use cases which should happen in what area.
		- **Helps to grow and develop abstract thinking.**
		- Ties in with the `components`, abstract thinking on different levels.
		- High levels flows of data. Structurings methods, same thinking at component level.
-
-
- ## Thinking area
- Also keep a bit more top of mind, **proactively doing the check of priorities**. The discussion we had with Penny.
- When new topic comes up; how does it fit in our plan/goals. Think about how does it fit and check that.
- Make sure to have a state somewhere where it's easy to see what the current priorities are.
-
- ## Execution
- Continue to practice with prod debugging f.e.
- Make Braze more reliable. (make product more mature) --> try to make it an example application for the rest)
-
-
- ## Talk 22 dec
- What are my goals?
	- End goal?
	- I want to learn a lot
	- I like responsibility
	- TEchnologies
	- If I go, can I go back.
-
- You learn by playing.

- # 25 jan
- Feel I'm doing some more of the project management as well. More discussions with Penny.
-
- How can I grow? You mention last time discuss more on a generic/abstract level.
- Are there other topics?
-
- I identified for myself; being able to more concisely and concretely explain things. Aka using less words to achieve the same.
-
- How should I participate in the team?
-
- How do we handle EPS?
- ArchUnit thingy.
-
- Should I give more context; from time to time I feel I didn't provide enough and you give some extra.
-
-
- # 8 feb
- Sometimes you already give the answer :)
- Where others might benefit from some ideation.
-
- We both try to read L3 stuff.
-
	- Try to get into a subteam state with Dirk and Jakob
