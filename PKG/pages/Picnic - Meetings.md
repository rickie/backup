- 02-22-2022: POM - Proxy DC's
	- Summary: [here](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/picnic-java-support-modules/pull/1753#issuecomment-1047655869)
	- Stock of ours in other (non-Picnic) DC's
	- Why not String? -> Short term.
	- In the future change for sure; warehouse, rethink different take on that.
	- Introducing this; not massively increase (lot of) tech debt.
	- Go for option one, not `PicnicWarehouseId` a bit overkill perhaps. Reconsidering.
-
	- Do we need to be able to derive it from the ID itself?
	- Put the lookup capabilities in `asset-service`?
-
- 02-22-2022: `messaging-support 2.0`
	- Summary: [here](https://teampicnic.slack.com/archives/GM1TJ5YNB/p1645031314477989)
	- Consumer allow : retry `n` number of times.
	- Support backup?
-
- PSM Release
	- Always in first week
	- https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/picnic-java-support-modules/pull/1753 --> Must go in.
	- We have to do it without Nathan now, otherwise it will be too much.
		- Create a branch, snapshot, commit to a branch.
		- Confident testwise everything works.
		- Upgrade PRs are open, add it to that.
	- Nathan om input vragen

- # Core's GraphQL for JPLA
- Meeting date: 8 December 2022.
- ## GraphQL
- API Design paradigm
- Submit queries to an endpoint.
-
- Downsides:
	- Harder for people to get used to this way of API design, requires mental switch as well.
	- Problem that it is not as nice as Immutables.
	- Currently pascal case is used.
	- No trace ID yet.
	- How do we handle error codes? Now only error messages.
	- No WebFlux? Only WebMVC.
-
- Two ways of doing:
	- Schema first, generate the rest
	- Other way around.
-
- Security is on the service level. We rely on endpoint level security.

- ## RabbitMQ direction unclear 16 dec
- Jarmila Nathan Ivan RIck
-
- Current requirements. Break over the future.
- Solve those problems?
	- Look at alternative implementations?
-
- We are behind versions quiter a lot.
- We run without resilience already quite a while. For 6 years.
- Miracle and accident.
-
-
-
- # 20 dec Rabbit MQ with Phil
- Could have been more pragmatic.
- Why only have this now?
-
- Maintanence --> QQ will help.
- Future, how would it run in the future.
- MS 2.0, bucket of many unknown things.
