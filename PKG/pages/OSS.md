- Intern EPS release
- Alternative for TravisCI -> GH Actions (use FOLO setup?)
- Release strategy --> tag based? use OSSHR staging or not? (first internal testing?)
- OSS-parent --> Compatible maken met EPS.
- Have a way to validate against downstream projects. (exists a PR in `oss-parent`) (Picniccer moet dit kunnen doen). Kijken of er al iets exist. Mensen de fork hebben, wil je de fork testen.
-
- PI tests
-
- Themes
	- What is the priority of OSS in Picnic?
-
- Andere repo's kan je direct checken of het werkt als je een update doet. EPS moet sws in een losse repo.

- # Meeting 21 April
- ^^Preparation notes^^
- https://picnic.atlassian.net/browse/PSM-1344 --> This ticket will be a research to decide on how to take action for "all" OSS repositories inside Picnic. You can track progress there.
- We indeed need stewards. A group of people that _wants_ to devote time to it.
- Why would we make it public? Really no value in it, for _Picnic_. Actions should speak louder than words in this case. Show we actively maintain it.
- Lower the barrier for ourselves, make sure we can maintain this with a relatively low effort.
-
-
- Good members of community. People see us.
- Release stuff, support it, or clearly state that we don't maintain it anymore.
- Business case;
-
-
- # Open source with Expedia.
- Driven by volunteers.
	- Not explain it wrt to costs. No return of investment.
	- Maintaining git and conferences is not "free".
		- Go to leadership and present case. This is why we require investment.
- Innersource. Establishing practices.
- Internal adoption is also important. Internal use.
- Try to get people interested that are "low effort".
-
- Core set of maintainers. Sometimes only 1. They don't map to a team expedia. The owners.
-
- Reasons
	- Good way to meet people across company.
	- Build connections.
	- Talk to leadership, or legal.
	- Not only Day to day work , something different.
	- OSS world, traditionally people do things in their spare time. Then burning out.
	- Freedom. You are the owner.
