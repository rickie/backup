- Change `delivery-article-issues-event` -> `delivery-content-change-event`.
- Use `delivery-content-service` instead of the `article-issue-service` to retrieve article modification data.

- Question;
	- Where to get the original price based on the `orderlineitemid`
	- 1) Which campaigns rely on the existing syncing of the deliveryarticleissues; can we migrate this? What is blocking us?
		- two tables; article issues and article substitiutions.
	- 2) In the new event are less details; do w e use those? Otherwise simple migration.
- Rule engine; syncing to db and triggering rules.
	- Have data that we need?
	- Can we migrate to a more long term structure?
- Service change; in RE probably not used, for COMM it is in receipt, similar analysis;
	- Which endpoints in COMM are affected?
	- Do we have data or did they drop it?
	- Can we migrate?
	- Could we instead work towards final solution; don't trigger via selli do it via braze.
