- TODO Move `json-support` from Store to PSM
- TODO Checkstyle
	- IdentityConversion
	- ImmutableSortedSetComparator
	-
- Extra notes
	- every module can have a refaster module; would be auto loaded as part of it.
	- Have renovate figure out a change is in a `refaster` module, so we handle it differentlyt
	- they come out of the box. but dependencies are really hard.
	-
	- so we have three things:
		- OSS
		- PSM
		- Repository wide.
	-
	- We should lower the barrier.
	-
	- Stephan mentions having EPS contrib module is better. Otherwise we would need to add many things to the annotatino processor path.
	- So Refaster doesn't require the actual dependencies to be there.
	- It will check if textually it matches and then match.
	- We don't run `.patch.sh` anymore. So that situation is not so ideal. If someone runs patch it will show it..
	- For now InlineMe covers part of the cases. We want to have this out of scope for now
	-
	- Small class in user service. Handler of DevicePushTopic event.
	- UserDetails EventHandler
	- @Header String deviceId in the endpoint
	- One layer higher in  `provideGeneralConsentDeclaration`.
	- Instead of eventhandler.
	- ```
	  // XXX: Drop after migration. 
	  if (consentDecalartion.contains(MISC_COMMERCIAL){
	  - CustomerAuthorzationHolder.getAuthorzation().getDeviceId()
	  userService.setPushSupscrribtionCOMMERCIAL
	  }
	  ```
	- Push triggers are transactional. To start saying hey these pushes are commercial; then we need to have migrated the constents.
