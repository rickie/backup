- ## Chat
- Error Prone, a static analysis tool we are heavily using at Picnic for years already, goes beyond just spotting bugs â€” it fixes them automatically. Our journey started with contributing simple fixes, evolving into an open-source repository with various plugins. These plugins run custom checks on your code during the build, making your code better by catching bugs, improving style, and following common coding guidelines. Using and extending this results in an ever more consistent and improving code quality. The checks will run on the machines of all developers for all builds. (XXX: how do we add this sentence, or should we drop:) This automation streamlines part of the code review process.
- Developing such a high impact tool also means dealing with responsibilities and challenges. Incorrect changes or compatibility issues can disrupt developers, indicating the importance of accurate and valid refactoring suggestions.
- Creating the plugin itself is not easy. Integrating against the Java Compiler and relying on an unsupported and scarcely documented API makes development and debugging tough. The average developer will never interact with these uncommon APIs. Plus, since our plugin is open source, it needs to be compatible with various Java versions and be able to run on any codebase. This calls for rigorous testing and validation to ensure the plugin is correct in all situations.
- Beyond the continued development, as maintainers we need to think about the adoption and usability of the plugin. As adoption requires a shift in the culture of the developers of the project, it's not easy to get a company to adopt this tool. To ease adoption we need to provide extensive documentation and configurability of the tool to minimize friction.

- Beyond the continued development, getting others involved is vital. Encouraging people to use and contribute to the project, especially when it affects a codebase significantly, requires a bit of a culture shift. Responsively handling issues, collaborating on feature requests, and giving constructive code reviews all play a role in the project's growth. This abstract sums up our experience with Error Prone, highlighting its benefits for our development and the challenges we tackle to keep it working smoothly.

- ## Content
- Error Prone is a compile time static analysis tool that can find _and_ automatically fix bugs. We started using this extensively within Picnic a few years ago. What started with contributing simple fixes upstream resulted in a open source repository that contains multiple plugins on top of Error Prone. Many custom rules run as part of the build on the machines of hundreds of developers.
-
- With this setup we can have significant impact on code consistency, quality and safe developers time by catching common mistakes. This also comes with responsibilities and some interesting challenges. Performing incorrect refactorings or having incompatibilities can impact the flow of developers. Therefore the correctness of the suggestions is important.
-
- Developing the plugin itself isn't easy. The tool integrates with the Java Compiler and uses an unsupported, and scarcely documented API, which makes debugging in the Java Compiler quite hard. Additionally, many people can use the plugin as it is open source. This requires being compatible with multiple JDK runtimes and being able to run on almost all code. To validate these things an extensive testing and validation process is required.

- Dealing with upstream. Maintainers can be slow, mainaining a fork to make it compatible with our own builds.
- Unsupported API.
- Versions of new Java support, supporting a wide variety of JDKs.

- What is different from other projects?
	- Impact can be  really high, so you need to be really sure about how to approach it.
	- Validation.
	- Need to be on top of things.
	- A contribution needs serious amounts of hours to review. A slow thing or incorrect one can have significant impact on build time and usability.
	- Correctness.
	- Your project runs on every machine and analysis the code.
