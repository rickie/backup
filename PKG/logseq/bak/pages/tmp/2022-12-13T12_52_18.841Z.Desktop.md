- Hi distribution team, as discussed with @Geert, I created a team collaboration channel for us.
-
- We came to this idea after we had something that we wanted to discuss with the Distribution team.
- In the context of an Error Prone upgrade PR, we were evaluating the `JobAlreadyExistsException` that lives in PSM. After a GitHub code search, we found that besides PSM this is only used in `picnic-distribution`, see [here](https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=owner%3APicnicSupermarket+JobAlreadyExistsException).
-
- As this is quite a specific exception and has only 1 downstream usages, we want to internalize this exception.
- Another interesting thing, is that we briefly investigated how the `DopServiceClient` is [used within Picnic](https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=owner%3APicnicSupermarket+DopServiceClient) and we saw that the only reference is in the `DopServiceClientConfig`, which in it's turn seems to not be used anywhere else, see [here](https://cs.github.com/?scopeName=All+repos&scope=&q=owner%3APicnicSupermarket+DopServiceClientConfig ).
-
- So two questions from our side;
- Is the `DopServiceClient{,Config}` used?
  If it is, would it be possible to create or use a different exception within `picnic-distribution`?

	- What is Error Prone, 7:02: https://youtu.be/B-GaOGuXvwA?t=421
	- Demo
		- Example "valid" Java code that is not flagged without Error Prone; 9:54: https://youtu.be/B-GaOGuXvwA?t=594
		- Show first simple result of enabling Error Prone on that "valid" code 11:13: https://youtu.be/B-GaOGuXvwA?t=673
		- Run Error Prone in "patch-mode", which means it'll fix our code automatically; 12:46: https://youtu.be/B-GaOGuXvwA?t=766
		-
	- Demo 2; create own checker that can fix our code:
