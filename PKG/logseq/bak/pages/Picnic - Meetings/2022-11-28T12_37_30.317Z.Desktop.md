	- Stock of ours in other (non-Picnic) DC's
	- Why not String? -> Short term.
	- In the future change for sure; warehouse, rethink different take on that.
	- Introducing this; not massively increase (lot of) tech debt.
	- Go for option one, not `PicnicWarehouseId` a bit overkill perhaps. Reconsidering.

	- Do we need to be able to derive it from the ID itself?
	- Put the lookup capabilities in `asset-service`?
