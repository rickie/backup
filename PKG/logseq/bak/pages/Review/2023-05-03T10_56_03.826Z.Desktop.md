- Wat wil ik graag doen
- Picnic experience.
- Andere zijn zoekende naar wat te doen / hoe in PSM te werken.
- Error Prone knowledge. Ownership nemen? Over half jaar / jaar? Stephan als Gatekeeper?
-
- Ik zie Stephan als tech lead en behandel hem ook zo. Door het werk dat we doen, omdat ik hem chill vindt. More of an observation.
-
- PSM Modules vind ik ook leuk. Samen met anderen werken aan verbeteren.

- # UPDATE!
- Toch gelukt; 500 euro opslag gekregen
-
- # Feedback
- Use RFC and documentation to find out what choice we should make (e.g for specific EP rules).

	- Feedback Phil:
		- Rick actively requests feedback for his defence and conference presentations. Rick also has given a number of different presentations internally and it has been really nice to see visible improvements in his presentation style, catering to the audience, refinement of content and demonstrations. I think with continued focus, Rick can become a real ambassador for all things JPLA including Open Source projects and sharing at tech meetups and conferences.
		  
		  With regards to presenting arguments, consider using documentation/RFCs for design and presentation of complex problems with a few options and attributing pros/cons to each. Just like how you called votes on choosing between two code patterns for a resulting refaster template. For more complex and beyond stylistic choices, well written design documents will help accelerate coming to a decision within the JPLA team

- # Review October 23 2022
- Points of feedback:
	- Show same drive, self-sufficientcy, ownership and mastery for other JPLA products/projects.
	- Sometimes Stephan usually being the main architect.
		- Easiest improvement would be w.r.t. the overall EPS.
	- Anticipating and prioritising requirements (and roadblocks!) *before* I work on them.
		- E.g. getting a (rough) overview of all the things that need to be done, in what order and when is hard for me. Sometimes still a bit chaotic.
	- He'd like to see take same mastery of writing clean code in other JPLA topics/projects.
	- Keep working on prioritisation.
	- Storytelling; both beginning and conclusions (plus potential followups) could be clearer.
	- Start dialog about where I want to go.
