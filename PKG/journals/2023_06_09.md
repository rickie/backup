- `extractVersion` Guava with release version suffix
-
- In our Maven project we have a Guava dependency with the `-jre` version suffix.
- We defined the following `"extractVersion": "^(?<major>\d+)(\.(?<minor>\d+))?(\.(?<patch>\d+))?(-jre)?$"`
- As a result, a PR is created with the following changes:
- ```
  -     <version>30.0-jre</version>
  +     <version>32.0.1</version>
  ```
- This change is not correct because we need the `-jre` suffix for the new version as well.
-
- How do we configure Renovate to also use the `-jre` suffix when updating the version.
- We would like to make sure that Renovate picks up on the changelogs of Guava and adds that to the commit.
-
- The configuration in question:
- ```
