	- **Checkstyle** is interested in using our checks. They are okay with us creating a PR for this.
	  Blocker: actually creating the pull request and making sure all their checks pass.
	- **Uber** is interested wants to use a [specific test formatting check](https://error-prone.picnic.tech/bugpatterns/ErrorProneTestHelperSourceFormat/). 
	  Blocker: [this GH issue](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/error-prone-support/issues/474) which is something we want to pick up after [upgrading JDK baseline PR](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/error-prone-support/pull/603).
	- **Reactor** is interested, create an issue in `reactor-core` to discuss this. Simon Basle is aware of this. It is not clear yet what the approach would be here, but this might result in the fact that we need to consider making multiple JARs.
	- **Mockito**: we have the `MockitoMockClassReference` [check](https://error-prone.picnic.tech/bugpatterns/MockitoMockClassReference/) and the `MockitoStubbing` [check](https://error-prone.picnic.tech/bugpatterns/MockitoStubbing/) that can be interesting to contribute upstream to Mockito. We can create a ticket and ask if they are interested. If we play it smart we ask if we can link to our website or create a check that cleans up the remaining  
	  We can get in direct contact with Tim vd Lippe, I know someone who has his contact details.
