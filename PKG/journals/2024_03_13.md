- initial discussion on propagating changes between Consent and Push topics
  
  ```
  So based on the extensive explanation above, it's quite clear we will have transition period where we need to propogate changes to the consent to the users pushtopic of that device, to handle the situations mentioned above.
  To show which cases we'll have to take into account when we want to cover all the scenario's, we wrote out the following:
  
  customer enables push topic
    - set the consent
    - Selligent assumes customer is pushable
    - UserService: filters devices with push topic
  customer on specific device disables push topic
    - is there any other device with this topic?
        - Yes, do nothing
        - No, unset the consent
    - Selligent assumes customer is pushable
    - UserService: filters devices with push topic
  
  customer enables consent topic
   - a) we set the push topic for all devices
   - b) we identify from which device they enabled the consent, and add the push topic only on that device
  customer disables consent topic
   - same, but the inverse of a.
   - same, but the inverse of b.
  ```
  
  summary of work to enable finer-grained audience checking inÂ Braze:
  
  ```
  Things we should implement to support finer-grained audience checking in Braze.
  
  - Syncing `PushTopic`s in Rule Engine: (low priority, defer)
     - solution: start syncing push topics per device
     - but, these are not used yet, so we can do later when we have use-cases.
     	 - Downside to deffering is that we need to run the backfill twice.
  
  - Propagate consent/pushtopic changes between services (important)
     - a) setup code to automatically propagate changes between Consent and Push Topic
        - Storefront: intercept consent call, invoke UserService to set Push
        - UserService / event: on Push Topic change, update consent
     - b) Release App with Feature Flag to perform mass-enable later when everyone upgrades
          - Challenge: delays enabling until customers have upgraded
     - c) EventHandler or synchronous flow:
          - consent changes -> (un)set push topic
          - push topic changes -> (un)set consent
  
  - Backfill existing consents to push topics (probably important, deadline TBD)
     - Script: list all customers having the consent, and then set the push topic for all their devices. This triggers an event which is synced to Braze.
  
  Challenge: in Selligent, we cannot change the webhook to specify the type of Push when triggering, so Selligent will not know which users will be reached.
    - This is currently also not the case, so it is probably fine to leave this as-is.
