- This is really good! why don't you plug it to intelliJ ?

- There is an Error Prone IntelliJ plugin that you can use to run it in your IntelliJ. It will show you the warnings and errors as well.
-
- Just to clarify: Error Prone is a compiler plugin and runs right after the compilation phase is done. The idea is that, by default, it runs as part of the build when you compile your code.
