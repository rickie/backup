  In general, I truly enjoy my work. I am always very excited to go to work :). There are many aspects that give me a lot of energy and continuous enthusiasm.
  
  There are parts that, ideally, would've been a little different. For example, I'd love to dive into some more Java related topics than we do now. Additionally, I would love to spent more time on implementing new things that are related to Error Prone. However, I understand the reality and why we have the roadmap that we have. Besides these things, I like working on  and being involved in many things that help support other developers. 
  
  I feel that my efforts related to EPS (that sometimes are outside of working hours) can show how committed I am to try and make this a success within Picnic (and the open source world). Every now and then I put in extra time (from a hobbyist POV ðŸ˜„).
  
  
  /// 2 What makes you motivated 
  
  I am surrounded by a lot of people that are motivated, smart, good programmers that are willing to share their knowledge, and are open to having good discussions. This is really important to me as I want to keep growing and learn many new things.
  
  Apart from that, being able to work on Error Prone Support together with Stephan and the team, is still an amazing thing for me. The project is cool and has quite some impact as well. This combined with the talks I can do about it, are awesome.
  
  As a team we can have quite some impact on Picnic and all developers. This makes our work important and impactful, which make me motivated to make the best out of our situation. 
  
  Our quest for a high code quality and consistent codebase is something I really like to be a part of.
  
  Especially compared to the moment I wrote my previous Leapsome review our team went through quite a transformation, in a positive way. To me, it feels that the team vibe is becoming stronger and stronger. We are building cool stuff, learning from each other and building up good connection with each other. We can do all this stuff while we are having lots of fun together. I feel there is a very open way of communicating, which I am very fond of.
  
  Only half joking here; the snacks, barista and epic lunches are also very nice ðŸ˜‡.
  
  //// 3 What hinders
  
  The high workload combined with having many responsibilities as a team can be quite challenging. Past quarter we had to shift our focus and learn quite some new things. I had to change my approach here and put more time into fully thinking a ticket through.
  
  It's of course in the nature of our team that we have so many tools that we are responsible for, but it definitely impacts performance. Our sheet with external requests/questions is huge. Not answering those would free up quite some time to focus and increase performance. This is of course something that is not possible but just to give an idea on why it impacts performance :). (I wrote this before we discussed getting rid of the @jpla-tech-support. Seems it might be possible after all ðŸ˜…).
  
  Well, we discussed this recently, but loosing time responding to Slack messages pretty quickly. I sometimes combine this with regularly peeking in my mailbox. As a result I tend to work on multiple things at a time. This impacts my performance and especially my focus time. Now I try to close both and work on only one task. This will be something that we should keep an eye on as it is not easy at all.
  
  Another thing that can slow me down is questions about topics that I don't know a lot about. We discussed this before, but it's mostly about some harder Spring or PSM module related questions that I haven't worked on too much. What we discussed is that I, together with e.g. Nathan, would dive into that and take extra time to focus on that. Last weeks we could do that sometimes and it helped me a great deal. This is still something we should keep improving. 
  
  It ties in with my previous point but; my experiences with debugging and detecting the root cause of something. I am still learning new ways in which I can do these things by using "Inductive and deductive thinking". It has shown great usefulness, so I should keep improving that as it will make my analyses better.
  
  
  //// 4 Contribs
  
  Review pull requests (in 2022 I reviewed over 1400 PRs):
  
  Dependency PRs of 7 different repositories (now 6 as Keycloak is not our responsibility anymore).
  
  Any kind of PSM improvements (internal or external).
  
  Renovate changes, onboard new repositories, changing suggested commit bot messages, or changing schedules.
  
  Review new changes in Error Prone Support.
  
  Any PR that teammembers created that is related to our roadmap.
  
  Work on picnic-spinnaker CI/CD. Just like the rest of the team help out with automating ourselves by improving Spinnaker.
  
  Create many PRs; since 1 January 2022 I created 785 PRs, of which there are 210 picnic-shared-tools upgrades and 114 for downstream validation.
  
  Do presentations about Picnic and Error Prone (Support). Creating, practicing and doing the actual presentations.
  
  I'm the "mentor" of Gijs, I make sure he can do work and help out wherever that is needed. Till now, he mostly focused on the TestNG migration. This usually means additional review efforts from my side and diving into the topics with him to provide guidance.
  
  Facilitating the actual TestNG migration. With a lot of effort and improvements we built something that others can use to migrate their TestNG code.
  
  Slack; being the tech-support and answer questions on Slack.
  
  EPS releases. Validate the EPS releases by applying it downstream, decide on scope and measure + validate impact.
  
  Error Prone Support work; try to make it "popular" in the company, help out people, discuss ideas, make roadmap and spec tickets. Try to do a lot of things related to making EPS a nice "brand" or a thing within Picnic, or outside of Picnic.
  
  Contributing to open source libraries. Due to the nature of PSM and our dependency management, we sometimes need to get our hands dirty and reach out to external libraries and report problems or even propose fixes for it ourselves.
