  # Developing a plugin that automatically fixes code.
  
  Error Prone, a static analysis tool we heavily use at Picnic for years
  already, goes beyond just spotting bugs â€” it fixes them automatically. Our
  journey started with simple fixes to the project, then evolved into a
  separate open-source project with various plugins. These plugins run custom
  checks on your code during the build, making it better by catching bugs,
  improving style, and following common coding guidelines.
    
  Developing an opinionated tool comes with plenty of responsibilities and 
  challenges. When done right, this kind of automation streamlines part of the 
  development and code review process. But incorrect code suggestions and
  compatibility issues will have the opposite effect; something we're
  continuously mindful of.
  
  Creating an Error Prone plugin is nontrivial. The Java compiler integration
  and its unsupported and scarcely documented APIs make development and
  debugging a challenge. Additionally, since our plugins are open source, they 
  need to be compatible with a range of Java versions and be able to run
  against any codebase. This calls for rigorous testing and validation.
  Beyond continued development, as maintainers we need to think about the 
  adoption and usability of the plugins we create. To this end we provide 
  extensive documentation and configurability.
