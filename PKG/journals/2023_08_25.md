- On `develop` in `DefaultWebTestClient` we could see that we had a header `VARY` containing two values, `x-picnic-auth` and `Accept-Encoding, User-Agent`. For `jpla/sb3-migration` we get one value with `x-picnic-auth, Accept-Encoding`.
-
- It is allowed to have multiple values. It is allowed to have comma separated values in one value. Where this change is coming from is not clear, but after some investigation we stopped, also because this is not really a problem.
