- Hello participants,
  
  To ensure a smooth experience during the workshop, we'd like to ask you to follow some instructions as preparation. We have an open-source repository, Error Prone support, were we created a `workshop` branch. In this README there is a section "Initial setup of the workshop" that we ask you to follow. This way we'll have more time to focus on the cool things during the workshop ;).
  
  If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to us for assistance via ...?
  
  Kind regards,
  
  Stephan Schroevers and Rick Ossendrijver
