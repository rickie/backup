	- Convert `UpdateSubscriptionsRequest` to immutables.
	- Add pushtopic;
-
- After Store upgrades to new platform we need to replace enum.
-
- Trigger push API to propagate what is the type.
	- CommunictaionControllerImpl; is it subscribed to the pushtopic that you want to check.
	- `sendFreeformPush` should accept type of PushTopic.CommunicationEvent.freeFormPush
	  `communicationController.getPushableDevices ` should only return devices that have the correct pushtopic consented.
- Toggle which was calling consent -> subscription. Considering the endpoint is a full replace. Collect state of "all" push toggles and send that.
- Store:
- Move `PushTopic`
	- Introduce new one,
	- document old one , the name
	- use that in `RegistrationApiController`.
	-
