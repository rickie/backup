## Hi everyone! I'm Rick Ossendrijver, and I'm thrilled to invite you to my talk at Automation Week. Ever wished you could say farewell to annoying bugs and anti-patterns in your codebase? Well, say hello to Error Prone! ðŸš€ At Picnic, we've leveraged its power to automate large-scale refactorings in Java, increasing the quality of our codebase and making it ever more consistent. Come and join automation week as I demonstrate Error Prone's magic.
