- Hi @trboyer, I'm wondering; do you have plans to work on this again in the coming weeks/months? 
  
  The reason I'm asking is that we are still really interested in this feature. Especially in the context of Error Prone Support and its usage at Picnic.
  
  In case you are not planning on spending time on this I want to see if I can get time for this internally. That will require some planning so it's not a given.
