- Based on this I have a question @Lucas @Florencia, we have to introduce a new consent/push topic `COMMERCIAL_PUSH` in the app as toggle in the privacy settings screen.
- Right now we have 1 toggle that updates the `PushTopic.PUSH_MISC` consent per device. However, if this is turned off for a device, the device cannot receive *any* push notifcation, which is wrong and too strict of a check (this check lives in Platform).
- We have four questions about the scenario where we would be introducing the `COMMERCIAL_PUSH` consent as either `PushTopic` ([link](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/picnic-platform/blob/b3eed7a4eb939e7b9296d01a001c7bf119a08d2b/datalayer/datalayer-models/src/main/java/com/picnic/model/user/PushTopic.java#L3)) or as a `ConsentTopic` ([link](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/picnic-platform/blob/b3eed7a4eb939e7b9296d01a001c7bf119a08d2b/atom/consent-service/consent-service-api/src/main/java/com/picnic/consent/api/ConsentTopics.java#L3)):
	- Would it take more time to implement this as toggle in both apps if it would be a `PushTopic`?
	- How long would it take to implement something like this?
	- How long would it take for a change like this to be live?
	- What would be the timeline for picking this up?
