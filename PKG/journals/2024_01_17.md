- Hi everyone,
- Thank you for attending my talk!
- Here are the slides: [Boost Developer Effectiveness with a Java Platform Team](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshows/boost-developer-effectiveness-with-a-java-platform-team-utrecht-jug/265507275)
- I received feedback that the QR code for providing feedback was not scannable. As I am keen on enhancing my presentation, storyline, and presenting skills, I would greatly appreciate your feedback! Please don't hold back ;).
- To provide feedback, please use this link: [Feedback Form](https://openfeedback.io/60Ghbx2DqiV8bu8iBzcb)
- Many of you mentioned an interest in seeing practical examples of the discussed tools. For this, I've shared a sample `pom.xml` file [here](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/error-prone-support/blob/master/pom.xml), closely replicating our internal setup. In the `<build>` and `<plugins>` sections, you'll find most of the tools I covered. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions: .
- Looking forward to your valuable feedback!
- Best regards,
  [Your Name]

- Many of you mentioned that I discussed interesting tools but would like to see an example of how to implement it. For that, please take a look at the pom file here: https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/error-prone-support/blob/master/pom.xml. This closely replicates our internal setup. In the `<build>` and `<plugins>` section we define most of the tools that I discussed. If there are any questions feel free to reach out to me: rick.ossendrijver@teampicnic.com.
