  External goals with EPS
  
  Public image; Picnic’s visibility in the tech space and community.
  Our goal is to be seen as a tech company. There are many things that contribute to such image.
  Error Prone Support is a special piece of software that, in a way, laat zien hoe Picnic is, staat daar goed voor.
  
  
  Collaborations
  One of the reasons that we shared our repository with the rest of the community, is that we believe
  it holds value for others as well. The best way to proof that "the community" thinks the quality is good, 
  is when other (big) companies and libraries are using EPS. 
  There are many people that have shown interest in using our checks. For some of those we need to take some action to 
  make it easily usable for them as well. 
  
  Collaboartions can be interesting, show potential.
  
  
  Responding and acting on external issues and requests.
  Having an open source repository that is activly promoted gets attention of uses
  
  External contributions.
  When developers are enthousiastic about an open source project, or are using one, 
  they might start contributing to it. When having clear guidance on external contributions 
  they be helpful and either fix or improve things for us. This doesn't always need to be code.
  Sometimes a GitHub issue that flags a problem can already help us. 
  
  We should be open, responsive and take action when a PR of issue is opened. 
  This is part of being a "business card" to the outside world. 
  
  Traffic to our website.
  Almost all points mentioned above can result in Growing our online

- **Being adaptable w.r.t. technologies:**
- -
- When a company is heavily using a library, migrating away to a (better) alternative can be costly, as the work has to be done manually and can be prone to errors. However, in the history we have shown that we can automat such migrations. This lowers risk and makes us adaptable.  Biggest cost i

- This contributes to us being able to focus on automating migrations of libraries. As a result, we can Lean and confined tech stack

- People write better code. Easier to migrate later.
  People constantly having ideas.
  Every month improvements, people used to it.

- Migrations, confined tech stack, less overhead. More adaptable. Ready for what’s to come.

- Having less libraries (-> AssertJ, → Reactor, → JUnit, → Jongo, → ???)

- Reducing risk, if we need to move to new technology, we can move fast.
