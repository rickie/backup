- Hey @cd-tech-support, we tried out the Datadog healthcheck stages in our pipelines in Braze ([PR](https://github.com/PicnicSupermarket/picnic-braze-bridge/pull/287)). We have a few questions about how to best use those in our pipelines.
	- How to handle deploying a fix while the DD monitor is not healthy? We were in the situation that our monitor was not "OK", so we couldn't deploy a fix.
	- [The monitor](https://app.datadoghq.eu/monitors/16657245?view=spans) we have configured contains "by market". However, I'm not able to deploy FR while one of the other countries is failing. Am I using it incorrectly or shouldn't it work like that? Do we need a monitor per country?
	- What we would expect is that after we deploy to e.g. FR PROD the monitor would see if for that most recent deployment with a "fresh state" we still have a green monitor before proceeding with the next release. Is our idea of the stage wrong? Can we achieve this by improving our monitor?
