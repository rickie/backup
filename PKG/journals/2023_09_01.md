- Vooral slide twee praat je vooral obv de tekst, zoals why upgrade, maybe moet dat even weg.
- Voorbeeld migration? javax. -> jakarta. Show one example because people will probably recognize it, could be fun?
- De style heeft wel wat maar er staat veel op de slide. Idk....
-
- ~~What does a Config have? Make clear you import one config and you get A LOT of things out of the box.~~
- ~~convergence/divergence.~~
- You can mention that we did the 40 clients within x amount of time with so many people.
-
- Deprecation of @EnableGlobalMS you gave an example of what we encountered but its not that visible.. Thats a bit harder.
- ~~Step 1: Keep scope minimal... Don't jump to latest version. Maybe not everyone knows OpenRewrite.~~
- JooQ version depending on an old version of Micrometer, those are like the funny things of this migration. Just like Jakarta Servlet 5 and 6.....
- 28: Picnic Parent.
- Step 4, 29: "Monitor" is probably the word that you mean.
- The last part of migration example, the full scheme is nice but it's a lot and to short that you go over it.
-
- 44/45, why not combine? That makes it stronger, I think it fits on one screen.
-
- Picnic parent is the one place to do the majority of the changes.
- Multipliciation vs. "Multiplier" factor
- Just say component tests vs blackbox.
