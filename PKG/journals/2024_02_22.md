- 1. Push consent refactoring (? BE days, review document)
	- [https://picnic.atlassian.net/browse/COM-545](https://picnic.atlassian.net/browse/COM-545)
	- [https://picnic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Braze/pages/4442652928/Push+notifications](https://picnic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Braze/pages/4442652928/Push+notifications)
- 2. Other channels (tag, gift, sms, in-app, ADS) (7 BE days, ? config in Braze, ? authentication)
	- note: we have to support tags because we need DWH integration. For ADS it's planned for Q2
- 3. DWH export of campaigns and canvases through Kafka (5 BE days, ? DWH data modeling)
	- [https://picnic.atlassian.net/browse/COM-722](https://picnic.atlassian.net/browse/COM-722)
- 4. Article Issue migration (COM + RE) (8 BE days)5. Receipt template for Variable Weight (2 BE days with Selligent, 15 BE days with Braze)
	- We go with Selligent because everything is already setup, Braze would take too long
	  
	  out of scope for this quarter:
- ADS->DWH syncing
- Custom Events: we don't need them for now, it seems we can use attributes
