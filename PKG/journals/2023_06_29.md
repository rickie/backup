  Hi Rob, sorry for my late response. Apparently my notifications are not setup correctly... Thanks for getting back to me!
  
  I'd like to ask if I can come back to this question in the future.
  
  We have many automatic rewrites that help and guide our developers with using Spring and Reactor in the best way possible. Some examples of these rules are on our documentation website: https://error-prone.picnic.tech/. 
  I was in contact with Simon Basl√© as well about this and we will first contact him and see how Reactor thinks about our rules and how could be involved in this. Currently, we are still thinking about a strategy we would like to propose for this. 
  
  So for now I want to say we do not directly need any help from you. When the time is there, I might reach out to you, for when we would like to get in contact with someone from Spring. We truly believe there are benefits to share our rules in a way and potentially collaborate on them.
