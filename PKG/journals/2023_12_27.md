- This PR disables a few checks from Error Prone Support. Additionally, the goal of this PR is to agree on how we are going to configure the rest of the checks in the `pom.xml`. If we, at some point, decide to either disable or enable more checks from Error Prone itself that have severity `WARN` or `INFO` we can do that in the same configuration section.
-
- Internally we have the convention to add a comment for every rule explaining why we disable it. If we would like the same here, I need your help to write the correct reasoning :). We can also decide to leave it like this. For now, I disabled two extra rules that are that will cause more noise than improvements.
