- Let's do feature flag
-
- What are reqs?
	- New PushTopic needs to be there.
	- Bi-directional binding
	- Migration history, backfilling.
- use feature flag, they roll it out, disable for everyone. We control when we start enabling.
-
- Scheduled;
- Action events; Custom event,
- API triggered.
-
- Difference:
	- Instead of two steps; you have 1 step if you do via API.
	- Couple of minutes on busy days like Black Friday.
- API is not costing datapoints; custom events does cost datapoints.
