- Its hard to track the performance of push campaigns right now. There are many devices that have invalid push tokens which we do not clean up. As a result, there are users with multiple (old) devices that we consider as "pushable". 
  
  We would like to know a few things:
	- For both OSes, what are the requirements / when can we consider a push token as "expired"?
	- Is there a way to unregister these push tokens if they are expired? Perhaps there is something provided by the OSes themselves for this?

- If there is nothing for this, we should consider creating something that will periodically clean up the push tokens.
